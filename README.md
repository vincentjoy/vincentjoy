## üöÄ About Me

Seasoned Software Engineer with 11 years of experience specializing in native iOS development using Swift, SwiftUI and UIKit. Additional expertise in cross-platform mobile development with React Native and backend API development using Django REST Framework. Proficient in Swift, JavaScript, and Python.

Throughout my career, I have balanced roles as a team lead, mentor, code architect, individual contributor and solo developer. I have contributed to products across diverse environments, from early-stage startups to publicly listed companies, spanning industries such as AI, IoT, Travel & Hospitality, Ride Hailing, Navigation, E-commerce and Streaming. .

Currently I am exploring possibilities in the emerging fields of AI and AR/VR, by developing applications in Generative AI and Vision OS, via personal projects.

‚úçÔ∏è **Technical Writer**: I share my development insights and tutorials on my blog **[Code Joy](https://code-joy.hashnode.dev)** where I write about iOS development, React Native, and software engineering best practices.
